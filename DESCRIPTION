Title: Data Sifter II Algorithm to Create Privacy-preserving Time-varying Data 
Version: 0.1.0

Description: The DataSifter2 package contains a set of effective tools for raw data preprocessing including missing imputation, creation of information and privacy-preserving datasets from raw data that contains time-varying measurements. It obfuscates data through artifical missing introduce and longitudinal imputation. DataSifter II is aimed at maximally preserving utility while introducing a proper level of privacy protection.Time-invariant variables in the dataset are recommended to be obfuscated with DataSifter I algorithm.
